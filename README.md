# Pyro Platform

Pyro is a platform that teaches programming through the hands on experience of building an app. [Pyro Platform](http://pyroplatform.com) is the front end that allows users to access this functionality without needing to understand setting up a development environment.

The [Pyro Library](https://github.com/pyrolabs/PyroLibrary) is available for use both within Pyro Platform as well as separately as a standalone javascript library.

* **Editor** - Directly edit your apps code within the browser without the need to save
